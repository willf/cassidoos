# cassidoos

Weekly coding challenge from @cassidoo

"Cassidoos" rhymes with "rendezvous".

1. 2020/02/07: Find a word exercise (Typescript)
2. 2020/02/14: Remote control exercise (Python)
3. 2020/02/21: Longest subsequence excercise (Python). Too lazy to do it in Typescript,
   which was the point of this repo :joy:
