#
# This weekâ€™s question:
# Given a string that represents items as asterisks (*) and compartment walls 
# as pipes (|), a start index, and an end index, return the number of items in a closed compartment.
#
# Example:
# 
# let str = '|**|*|*'
#
# > containedItems(str, 0, 5)
# > 2
# 
# > containedItems(str, 0, 6)
# > 3
#
# > containedItems(str, 1, 7)
# > 1
# Extra credit: What if you had multiple pairs of start and end indices? You can do it in O(n) time!
